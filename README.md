# HW_1
CMakeProject6.cpp is the main file
Ensure that all .cpp file and .h files listed in CMakeLists.txt are downloaded for main file to properly call all functions.

Below are the instructions for each question of HW_1 

Question 1: To view each time step iteration through 5 seconds, delete double backslashes in front of line 75 of the main file.

Question 2: To view each time step iteration through 5 seconds, delete double backslashes in front of line 76 of the main file.

Question 3: To view each time step iteration through 5 seconds, delete double backslashes in front of line 77 of the main file.

Question 4: To view the dot product double z, delete double backslashes in front of line 83 of the main file.

Question 5: To view sigmoid(z) and gradient_sigmoid(z), delete double backslashes in front of line 86 and 87 respectively of the main file.
NOTE: Functions for sigmoid(z) and gradient_sigmoid(z) are in main file.

Question 6: To view gradient_cost(y_predict, y), delete double backslashes in front of line 93 of the main file.

Question 7: The differential weights and updated weights cout automatically. No action required.
NOTE:Functions for gradient_weights() and update_weights() are outside of main() within the main file.

Question 8: The final result for w after 500 iterations couts autmatically and are within [-1 1]. No action required.
NOTE:Functions to update the weights, for each aircraft 500 times, are in main() of the main file starting on line 122.

Question 9: The predicted results for each aircrat cout automatically, all of which have been predicted correctly. No action required.
NOTE:Functions to predict the engine type are in main() of the main file starting on line 236.
